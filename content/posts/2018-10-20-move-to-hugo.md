We're moving!

I'm not against Jekyll all of a sudden, but I tend to change computers a lot. Installing a bunch of Ruby dependencies / Gems while wanting to write a quick blog is not fun. I also wanted to start hosting this site on my own VPS @ [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) for more control and bespoke stuff I'd like to track. (Which I cannot think of now)

[Go check out Hugo if you want a simple site which you can setup quickly!](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/)

I use the [kiera](https://github.com/avianto/hugo-kiera) theme.

Stuff I think is improved in comparison to the old site:

 - RSS support out of the box! ([Cause you need to practice what you preach](https://twitter.com/BasLangenberg/status/1047417069178933250))
 - Single binary generator which I can quickly install
 - Flat files are still the best way to blog for me
 - Everything *Still* in Git!
 - Pushing a new version of the website is now being done locally on my laptop, which gives me more control of the process and does not require me to rely on Github

If people are looking for some easy way to setup a blog, I would recommend Hugo. I still don't know a lot about it, which I think is really nice since it points out how easy it is to start using it.

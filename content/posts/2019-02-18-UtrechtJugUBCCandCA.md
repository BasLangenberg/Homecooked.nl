On the seventh and eight of February, I attended the Utrecht's Java User Group meetup with Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin. This was done in collaboration with my old customer Rabobank. I had a lot of fun, and it was nice to be at the auditorium of Rabobank again.

I've written a blog about this on my employers website. You can find it ***[here](https://www.syntouch.nl/java-user-group-7-8-februari/)***

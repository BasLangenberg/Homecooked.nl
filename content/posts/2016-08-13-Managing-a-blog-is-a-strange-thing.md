title: "Managing a blog is a weird thing"
---

So for some reason my template decided to store it's css externally, and I didn't notice untill a few weeks ago that the domain of my template's creator expired and my blog had the appearance of a website in 1994. An hour of hard work fixed this.

Apparantly I care enough about this place, so I should put a bit of effort in this. I think I'll use this blog to share some content of projects I am currently working on. Expect some content about Docker, Puppet and WebLogic in the coming few months.

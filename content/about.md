 I'm terrible at writing about pages

So my name is Bas. I'm living in the town of Voorschoten, near Leiden, The Netherlands. Originally, I am from Bergen op Zoom, which is in the south of the Netherlands. I am an integration consultant for [SynTouch](https://www.syntouch.nl). To put it in short, I help my customers to work out how complex IT systems can exchange information in the best way.

I've started out working remote techical support for J.D. Edwards. Due to the fact that this ERP suite is running on a lot of systems, I gained experience with all kind of operating systems, databases, application servers. I also got a lot of exposure in managing incidents and keeping customers happy

After doing this for over 7 years, I decided I wanted to be a consultant. I became a Oracle Fusion Middleware consultant with a focus on WebLogic, after which I moved into general integration. Still doing a lot of Oracle at the moment, but I am excited to what's next. 

As the world is moving fast, and IT is moving even faster, I decided to start this blog in the middle of 2015. The main purpose of this blog is to share knowledge with.. myself. Writing it down allows me to forget the details, and makes room to learn even more. ;-)

If you would like to learn more about me, feel free to contact me on Twitter.
